## DynamoDB
In DynamoDB, tables, items, and attributes are the core components. Each item in a table has a unique identifier, or primary key 

### Definitions
> Table: collection of items (data).
> Item: collection of attributes. Items resemble rows and records in other database systems. No limit to number of items in table.
> Attributes: Is a fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down further i.e. PersonID, LastName, FirstName
> Primary Key: identify each item in a table
> Secondary Indexes: provide more querying flexibility
> DynamoDB Streams: Capture data modification events in DynamoDB tables
